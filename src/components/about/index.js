        <p>To develop individuals and small teams’ ability to maximize creativity, collaboration and flow by coaching and training resiliency.</p>
        <p className='header'>Vision</p>
        <p>Our vision is to see individuals and teams succeed against all odds because they develop resiliency in the face of defeat.  Instead of seeing failure as a tragedy they see it as competitor and learning opportunity.  We seek to develop teams who don’t let lack of traditional education or training hold them back.  They value resilience, fortitude, and the ability to adapt above all else.  Technical skills can be taught, soft skills can be developed, but resilience, that is what makes a legend.</p>
